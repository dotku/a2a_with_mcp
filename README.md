#  A2A + MCP: Multi-Agent Financial Analysis System

This repository demonstrates a practical, real-world implementation of Google's **Agent-to-Agent (A2A)** protocol combined with Anthropic's **Model Context Protocol (MCP)**. Together, these open standards enable seamless interoperability between modular AI agents.

---

## ðŸŒŸ What Does This Project Do?

We built a multi-agent system designed for financial market research, sentiment analysis, data scraping, and data visualization. Users interact through a streamlined UI, asking questions about crypto or market trends. Under the hood, requests are delegated to specialized agents via A2A, each powered by contextual data from MCP servers.

---

## ðŸ“Œ Architecture Overview

* **UI Orchestrator (A2A Client):**  Accepts user queries and forwards them using the A2A protocol.
* **Remote Orchestrator (A2A Server):** Delegates incoming tasks to specialized agents.
* **Specialized Agents:**

  * **Financial Agent:** Fetches crypto prices from local (Postgres MCP) and remote (CoinCap MCP) sources.
  * **Sentiment Agent:** Analyzes market sentiment using the Reddit MCP server.
  * **Scraper Agent:** Gathers additional market data through a Web Scraper MCP.
  * **Visualization Agent:** Prepares and generates visual charts.

All components communicate via standardized JSON-RPC (A2A) and access data via MCP.

# ðŸš¦ Getting Started

Clone the repository:

```git clone https://github.com/anshulLuhsna/a2a_with_mcp.git```

```cd a2a_with_mcp```

Note: Each agent (and each MCP server) has its own requirements.txt. This keeps dependencies lightweight and fully modular.

Install dependencies per componentâ€”e.g.:

### Financial Agent deps
```pip install -r agents/financial_agent/requirements.txt```

### Sentiment Agent deps
```pip install -r agents/sentiment_agent/requirements.txt```

### Scraper Agent deps
```pip install -r agents/scraper_agent/requirements.txt```

### Visualization Agent deps
```pip install -r agents/visualization_agent/requirements.txt```

### Remote Orchestrator deps
```pip install -r agents/orchestrator_agent/requirements.txt```

### UI dependencies
```pip install -r demo/ui/requirements.txt```

(Feel free to create a virtualenv or conda env first.)

ðŸš€ Running the Demo

Run Agents:

## Manually start each agent, e.g.
```python -m agents.orchestrator```
```python -m agents.financial```
```python -m agents.sentiment```
```python -m agents.scraper```
```python -m agents.visualization```

Start the UI:

```cd demo/ui```
```uv run main.py```

Open the UI at http://localhost:8501
